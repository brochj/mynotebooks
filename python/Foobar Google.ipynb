    "- multiple concepts ranging from number theory to graphs\n",
    "- Two classic graph problems i.e. max flow and maximum matching\n",
    "- Implementing these made me reference CLRS book, which is short form for [Introduction to Algorithms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Introduction_to_Algorithms), a great book to learn about algorithms.\n",
    "- Extensive knowledge of algorithms and data structures is required at this level.\n",
    "- number theory and graphs. I had to implement the **Bellman-Ford algorithm** in order to solve this question.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Level 5\n",
    "- was purely mathematical. It was related to permutations\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Take your time.** Google gives you plenty of time to finish each problem (Over 20 days in case of the level 5 problem). So there's no need to hurry, research the problems thoroughly and design a optimized solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Know thy standard library.** For a lot of the combinatorics type problems, the python standard library was absolutely godsend. Don't code up functions that are already provided by Python/Java's standard library.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Take a break between problems** There's no time restriction between problems, so you can take as much time as you want before requesting a new problem. Some of these problems need a lot of time to finish, so don't rush in requesting new problems unless you're sure you have the spare time to invest on it.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Do Foobar to learn, not for a job** Foobar probably isn't the most efficient way to get a interview at google. It's completely uncertain if and when a recruiter will respond. So instead of worrying about that, do Foobar to learn, that way you'll be under a lot less pressure.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Don’t Overthink**\n",
    "Overthinking can make you use algorithms that might be overkill. For one question I went on to implement Edmund’s Blossom algorithm while all I needed was a simple depth first search based bipartite matching. **All the questions in foobar are mostly solvable in under 400 lines of code**.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Don’t feel like it is the only way into Google**\n",
    "This can cause a lot of panic for you when you are near the time limit and you have to solve it or you won’t get into Google! Not really, actually foobar doesn’t get much special attention either. I was contacted by a Google recruiter but I don’t think she knew I had taken foobar, she just pointed me to take part in Kickstart as a new grad applicant. I didn’t apply, so it was just foobar but they saw it as an application because I had selected “Graduating in 1 year” in level 3 form.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Refer to the internet when you don’t know**\n",
    "When I got the markov chaining question, I searched “how to find probability of ending states” and I got the theories I needed. **Foobar is more about learning quickly and implementing instead of knowing everything and implementing**. You might hit a question that you have no idea about. The internet will be a friend, but don’t let it spoil you."
